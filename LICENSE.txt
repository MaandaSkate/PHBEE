### Additional Resources

- **Service Account Key**: Ensure that you have a Google Cloud service account key file and place it in the project directory. Update the path in `app.py`.

After creating these files, you can upload them to a GitHub repository. 

Here's a quick guide to do that:

1. Initialize a new Git repository:
    ```sh
    git init
    ```

2. Add the files to the repository:
    ```sh
    git add app.py requirements.txt README.md
    ```

3. Commit the changes:
    ```sh
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

4. Add the remote repository (replace the URL with your GitHub repository URL):
    ```sh
    git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/educational-task-generator.git
    ```

5. Push the changes to GitHub:
    ```sh
    git push -u origin master
    ```

This will upload your application to GitHub, and you can then deploy it on Streamlit Cloud Community by linking the GitHub repository.
